**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Sometimes, when navigating through the checkout process, it's confusing to change the quantity of items in the cart. Users have to manually input the quantity; it would be more intuitive to have +/- buttons for adjusting the quantity.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I'd like to see the addition of +/- buttons next to the quantity field in the shopping cart. Clicking '+' should increase the quantity by one, and '-' should decrease it accordingly.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
An alternative could be implementing a drag-and-drop feature for adjusting quantities. However, this might be more complex to implement and could potentially confuse users who are accustomed to standard input methods.

**Additional context**
This feature enhancement would improve the user experience during the checkout process, making it more user-friendly and intuitive. It aligns with the current industry standard in e-commerce platforms.
